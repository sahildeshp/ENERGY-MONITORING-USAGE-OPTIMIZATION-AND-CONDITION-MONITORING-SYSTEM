The primary objective of the proposed system is to precisely monitor the energy consumed by each individual device present at a premise.The electronic module shall be a replacement for a standard household switchboard and additionally
would be able to calculate and locally display the energy consumed by the devices
connected to the same. A certain premise may have several switchboards installed,
controlling numerous devices in which case, one of the many modules shall be the
master module.

Data from all the modules along with device identification shall
be relayed to the master. The master module in any premise shall be able to communicate along with the PC application software that would be the heart of the
system. The application software shall provide an advanced graphical user interface to the user from where, the user shall be able to not only control the many
modules, but also view energy consumption of the appliances connected in various
formats such as graphical or numerical. It will receive energy consumption data
from the electronic modules and over period of time and analyse the data to understand the variations in energy consumption of a particular device. The learning so
far acquired by the PC Software shall be used by the same to monitor the condition
of a probable failing device, a device that may be under maintenance or a device
that is completely un operational. 

It will also learn the usage of a particular device
and generate a projected energy meter bill for the user and by extension, an energy
usage plan.
